## vue3-demo

You can find the preview link [HERE]()

Since it's for demo purpose only I ignored the build process, so just lint and test are perform in CI CD

I also added in the husky that helps linting and unit testing locally on every commit before it gets pushed to repo. The unit test can be ignored corresponding to growing of project source code. 

Code coverage also be enabled but don't count on that, since we don't need test for everything but components. 

There is a preview link created automatically on each PR, that's help us to final test the changes on UI before finally rolling out.

**I prefer ReactJs/NextJs over VueJs, since it's less compicated and more joy**
